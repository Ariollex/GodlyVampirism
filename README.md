**Godly Vampirism**
======================================

This is a simple addon for Vampirism which enforces certain configuration options to remove all drawbacks from becoming a Vampire (or Hunter).  
Currently, this is provided for convenience only as all this can be accomplished by Vampirism's configuration as well.  

**Attention** This forces certain config options in Vampirism, therefore, if you change them, they will be reset by this mod.
